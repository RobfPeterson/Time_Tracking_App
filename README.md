# Time Tracking App

This is a quick python function I put together to monitor my app and website usage. I wanted to employ a behavior economics concept, loss aversion, by giving myself a nonrenewing pool of points. Failing a goal would initiate a loss of points. This is effectively a commitment device like those employed by [StickK](https://www.stickk.com/aboutus), and was partially inspired by wanting a non monetary way of employing such devices.

I used sqlite, both to practice at applying sql in a practical format and to leverage the existing documentation, and JSON for storage.
